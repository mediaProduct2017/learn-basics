    "## Quiz: is it a palindrome\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, I am a full-stack engineer here you know udacity\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a coach in the full-stack team\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm gonna interview philipp for a full-stack engineering position. All right, let's get started with the first question. Are you comfortable with python, first of all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I am.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, perfect. So our first question we are going to write a simple python method. I want you to write a method that takes in a string, and tell me whether or not it's a palindrome. Do you know what a palindrome is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah it's just like a string that's the same forwards or backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "So examples are?\n",
    "\n",
    "like race car. Do you care if it has spcaes in it?\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, let's not worry about spaces. we will do that if we have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right. Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, do you mind if I name this method or procedure?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. It should return a boolean by the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, got it. So I'll name it is_palindrome. You know when I name a method, I like to give it a name that's readable. And it'll take in the string called s. Ok, we'll just go by the definition of palindrome to keep things simple. And what I am doing here is I am going to use python slicing notation just to reverse the string and see if it's the same in either direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, that was quick. Can you show me what it would look like without the double colon syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "You mean like reverse it in a different way?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hm\n",
    "\n",
    "So presumably strings have a reverse method on them, I might try that. That would be more readable to people who aren't pythonistas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, exactly, if I am coming from a different language, I might not know this immediately. So what you say you would do first is you would reverse it. Let's assume strings have reverse method and start from there. (list有reverse method，可以先转成list，反转后再转回string). So let's say python gives us a reverse method and gives us a new string. Show me how you would do it if you have that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So assuming we have a method called reverse, do you mean a method on the string or just a function that you call with the string as a parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The function you call with the string as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "So assume this returns a string that doesn't modify s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take into the case where you now have spaces. So an example would be a sentence let's see if I could get that. a man a plan a canal panama. And If you read this backwards, a man a plan a canal panama.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I guess another way to phrase the question is, is it a palindrome if you ignore the spaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure I can do that. So the way I do it is before I do this check here you have got to keey the same base structure. Before I do this check, what I want to do is just remove the spaces from the string s. This is a bulit-in method in python so it's super convinient.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def is_palindrome(s):\n",
    "        s = s.strip()\n",
    "        return s == reverse(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you write me one or two tests to make sure it's working as expected?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume this is like a python file. What I would do is I will call the function. An important thing to do is to test with positive cases and negative cases. If this is a real example I would print this is the expected true result. That way when I pring my next line, the results are readable. I guess you could do an edge case too.\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Test case 1: expected result is True\")\n",
    "    print(is_palindrome(\"racecar\")\n",
    "    print(is_palindrome(\"\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Can you tell me what's the runtime of this method now?\n",
    "\n",
    "So starting from the top, we would go line by line. So string.strip(), this is in the standard library, I didn't write it but I can guess How it works. Like what I imagine, it goes character by character. And it kind of builds a new string. It probably goes through the entire string once. It's probably an O of n. This is the first step. Then I compare the two strings to see if they are equal, which means it has to iterate the two strings at the same time. That's also an O of n. an O of n plus an O of n equals an O of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, perfect. And what's the memory consumption?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the begining we have the size of the string s, let's call it n. Then we need a strip verson of it and a reverse version of it. So two n, the result is the big O of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the palindrome question was a warm up, making sure he is able to write basic code, knows a programming language well enough. He ended up knowing it really well and it's also a good way to check if the candidate knows how to write good test cases. Phillip did really well in pulling up positive cases where the function succeded and negative case where it fails. So that was the main things that I was looking for in it.\n",
